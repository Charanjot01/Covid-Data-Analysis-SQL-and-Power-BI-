# SQL | Power BI
# COVID’19 Data Exploration and Analysis
## Introduction
This project explores and analyzes the COVID-19 infection, death and vaccination rates all around the world using SQL and Power BI dashboard.
## Dataset
Covid-19 data from January 01, 2020, to January 30, 2023 from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
## Skills and Tools Used
SQL, MS SQL Server, Power Query Editor, Power BI, DAX
## Objectives
This was my first project and its main goal was to practice and showcase all the concepts I have learned so far in SQL and Power BI. I have answered the following questions in this project:

•	What are the global number of total Covid-19 cases and deaths, death percentage and percentage of fully vaccinated population?

•	What is the percentage of infected population per country?

•	What is the total number of deaths per continent and top 10 countries with the highest number of deaths?

•	Number of people fully vaccinated in comparison to the total population.

•	Which are the top 10 countries with highest number of people fully vaccinated?

## Development of the project

I imported the dataset into MS SQL and created three views containing the pertinent information on Covid deaths, vaccinations and the location. Then, these three views are imported into Power BI Desktop (PBI) and ETL process was done via Power Query.

To get the correct values about the covid deaths and vaccinations, I made use of  calculated columns and quick measures. At the end, I was able to create the dashboard answering the question presented above.
After completing the dashboard, I returned to SQL and created queries to answer the same questions in order to compare the results obtained in Power BI, which also served the purpose of developing my SQL skills.
